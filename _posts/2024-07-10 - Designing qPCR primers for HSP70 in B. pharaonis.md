# **Designing qPCR primers to test for heat shock proteins (HSP) 70 in *Brachidontes pharaonis* in the presence of heat stress**

## **Designing the primers (forward and reverse) to detect HSP70 in *B. pharaonis***

I could not identify the paticular sequence that codes for HSP70 in *B. pharaonis* because its whole genome is not sequenced yet. To be able to get sequences that may code for theis gene, I visited the website of the [ National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and searched for *Mytilus* HSP70 in the database. I selected and downloaded the FASTA sequences of five *Mytilus* species since they share the same family with *B. pharaonis*: *Mytilus galloprovincialis* HSP70 mRNA, *Mytilus edulis* HSP70 mRNA, *Mytilus trossulus* HSP70 mRNA, *Mytilus californianus* HSP70 mRNA, and *Mytilus coruscus* HSP70 mRNA.

## **Alignment of Sequences**

I then aligned the five downloaded sequences using  [CLUSTALW](https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw). This helped me identify the conserved and variable regions of the sequences. I proceeded with the conserved regions for the primer design.

## **Picking of Primers**

I visited the [Primer3](https://primer3.ut.ee/) website for the primer design. I pasted the conserved sequence and set the primer size range to 1000-1500 base pairs, then clicked on "Pick Primers."
