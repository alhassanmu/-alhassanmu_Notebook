## **Selection of Sequences**

To begin with the primer design, I decided on my target gene and selected the 16S rRNA gene because it is a conserved gene in bacteria. I visited the website of the [ National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and searched for *Endozoicomonas* in the nucleotide database. I selected and downloaded the FASTA sequences of four *Endozoicomonas* species: *Endozoicomonas* *euniceicola*, *Endozoicomonas* *gorgoniicola*, *Endozoicomonas* *numazuensis*, and *Endozoicomonas* *montiporae* because they are closely related.

## **Alignment of Sequences**

I then aligned the four downloaded sequences using  [CLUSTALW](https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw). This helped me identify the conserved and variable regions of the sequences. I proceeded with the conserved regions for the primer design.

## **Picking of Primers**

I visited the [Primer3](https://primer3.ut.ee/) website for the primer design. I pasted the conserved sequence and set the primer size range to 1000-1500 base pairs, then clicked on "Pick Primers."

## **Phylogenetic Analysis**

I created a phylogenetic tree for the four sequences using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 11.
